# Project

In this project we have used pyhton for machine learning and an python framework called django to create this is project..

First we create a machine learning model using the dataset and various pyhton libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, pandas etc..

Then we design the backend and frontend..

For the front we use html, css and javascript.

For the backend we use django.

First we created a project named MPG..

Then we create a app called firstapp in django and begin our project..

After creating the machine learning model , frontend and backend we use the model to perdict the MPG..
